I used the following tutorial to create a self hosted app. It's a ToDo List with some nice features like automatic dates, checkboxes, completed items, one-click creation of new items and restoring of completed items back to the list.

It can be hosted locally or as a remote file on any of the file hosting services like Dropbox, etc.

This is a template of the ToDo list created during the tutorial. The list is almost entirely blank so that you can copy it to your drive and simply start using it.

Note about browser security:
As most browsers prevent websites from saving anything to your drive you will need to go to https://tiddlywiki.com/ to select a plugin for your browser so that will let you save your changes.
